# bling-stubs

The production version of [Bling](https://github.com/paintparty/bling), a hi-fidelity printing library for Clojure, ClojureScript, and Babashka.

<br>

Use this version in production builds. It has the same api as Bling, but there is zero runtime cost, as all of the functions return nil or blank strings.

<br>

## Usage
```Clojure
[io.github.paintparty/bling-stubs "0.8.8]
```
